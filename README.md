3. Note: Since Angular6.1, we can also use ```{ scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled' }``` on **eagerly loaded** modules and it will be applied to all routes:

4. Note that as of 6-Nov-2019 using Angular 8, at least, the scrollPositionRestoration property does not work with dynamic page content (i.e., where the page content is loaded asynchronously): see this Angular bug report: <http://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24547>
